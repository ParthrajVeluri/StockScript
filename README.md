SQLDatabase.py retrieves historical data previously stored in a local mySQL database and breaks it down to calculate monthly average price

DirectAPI.py is a python script which uses ICICI breeze API to place orders based on conditions and stream real time stock data. I tried to implement TTS functionality to make the script read out the order execution details which can not only improve user experience but also assist the visually impaired. However, I was unable to successfuly implement it as the API had no way to stream order executions in real time. So a brute force method was used to manually "stream" changes in stock executions in realtime using a while loop. This is obvioviously highly impractical and it led to an API timeout as the while loop exceeded the daily API call limit.
